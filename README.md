# Ranking Loss: Maximizing the Success Rate in Deep Learning Side-Channel Analysis
The current repository is associated with the article "<a href='https://tches.iacr.org/index.php/TCHES/article/view/8726'>Ranking Loss: Maximizing the Success Rate in Deep Learning Side-Channel Analysis</a>" available on <a href='https://tches.iacr.org/index.php/TCHES/index'>IACR Transactions on Cryptographic Hardware and Embedded Systems (TCHES)</a> and the <a href='https://eprint.iacr.org/2020/872'>eprints</a>.

The optimized Ranking Loss has been developed by Pritha Gupta (credit: <a href='https://github.com/gabzai/Ranking-Loss-SCA/issues/1'>issue 1</a>) and validated on Tensorflow 2.0.

Each dataset is composed of the following scripts and repositories:
- <b>cnn_architecture.py</b>: provides the script in order to train the model introduced in the article,
- <b>exploit_pred.py</b>: computes the evolution of the right key and saves the resulted picture (<b>Credit</b>: Damien Robissout),
- <b>(Optionnal) clr.py</b>: computes the One-Cycle Policy (see "<a href='https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.07120'>Super-Convergence: Very Fast Training of Neural Networks Using Large Learning Rates
</a>" and "<a href='https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.09820'>A disciplined approach to neural network hyper-parameters: Part 1 -- learning rate, batch size, momentum, and weight decay</a>,
- <b>"training_history"</b>: contains information related to the loss function, the accuracy
- <b>"model_predictions"</b>: contains information related to the model predictions,
- <b>"fig"</b>: contains the figure related to the rank evolution.
- <b>"..._trained_models"</b>: containts the model used in the article.

The trace sets were obtained from publicly databases: 
- <b>AES_HD dataset</b>: https://github.com/AESHD/AES_HD_Dataset
- <b>ASCAD</b>: https://github.com/ANSSI-FR/ASCAD
